# 4109
This Repository contains a review book for the Math 4109 curriculum. All who are in the program are welcome to contribute. If you wish to read or print this document, it is available [here](https://github.com/Jonathan-Z/4109/raw/master/main.pdf).

You can contribute in the following ways:
1. If you are familiar with LaTeX and the git version control system, please contact one of the maintainers so you can commit directly to this repository. You can also email a maintainer any changes you wish to make.
2. If you are not familiar with LaTeX, you are free to contribute by emailing a file in Plaintext, Google Docs, or MS Word formats to a maintainer.
3. You may also contribute by putting a file into this folder on Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OZ83WaRzVaexu_coong8HDmz-D7jCgFW?usp=sharing).
4. If you wish to include any drawings or diagrams, it would be of great help if exact coordinates are specified, though these do not have to be in the actual diagram. Please note that document description languages and vector graphics are preferred over raster images (unless the media presented makes it so that raster images are a preferred format in this case). The order of preference for the format of diagrams is as follows:
    1. Gnuplot scripts (If said media is a graph)
    2. Tikz pictures or PGF
    3. SVG files
    4. PDF files
    5. PostScript files
    6. PNG or other lossless compression for images. (for graphics that can be done in a vector format)
    7. JPEG or other lossy compression for images. (for graphics that can be done in a vector format)
