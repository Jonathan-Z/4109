You can contribute in the following ways:

2. If you are not familiar with LaTeX, you are free to contribute by emailing a file in Plaintext, Google Docs, or MS Word formats to a maintainer.
3. You may also contribute by putting a file into this folder on Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OZ83WaRzVaexu_coong8HDmz-D7jCgFW?usp=sharing).
4. If you wish to include any drawings or diagrams, it would be of great help if exact coordinates are specified, though these do not have to be in the actual diagram. Graphics should preferably be in a vector format if possible.
